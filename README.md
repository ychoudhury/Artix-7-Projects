# Artix-7-Projects
Self-guided, self-learning projects on a Basys 3 board for fun


###### LEDSwitch
Essentially a "hello world" type program used to familiarize myself with Vivado

###### excess2CodeConverter
An excess 2 code converter that drives the Basys 3's 7 segment displays(s). The output was designed using a total of 16 or fewer two, three, and four input NOR gates and inverters. On the digital logic side, this was practice implementing DeMorgan's Law and creating a design based on a two layer configuration of universal NOR gates. On the FPGA side, this was practice to get the 7 segment display up and running.
